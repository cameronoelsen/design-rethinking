                            The tag “rock star” is recklessly applied to everyone from bloggers to biochemists, but in Paula Scher’s case it couldn’t be more appropriate. As a rock star designer, she’s cooked up everything from Boston album covers to Elvis Costello posters, pausing somewhere in between to trash the ubiquitous visual authoritarianism of Helvetica. She’s also created some of design’s most iconic images, like the Citibank logo. She is a partner in the renowned design firm Pentagram, and in 2001 received the distinguished AIGA medal. As a fine artist, Scher has also become increasingly well known for her microscopically detailed map paintings, densely latticed with hand-lettered text, that evoke not only place but the varied political, historical and cultural meanings (and preconceptions) brought to the world by the viewer.

                            Design-wise, Isaac Mizrahi is best known for bridging the gap between high and low — creating gorgeous couture confections for the likes of Eartha Kitt and others, as well as a hugely popular, ground breakingly affordable line for Target. His design mission comes wrapped in endless charisma. He’s a talk-show host, he’s performed his own one-man show Off-Broadway, he was the subject of the hilarious documentary Unzipped, and he does regular cabaret nights at Joe’s Pub in New York City. His new book is called How to Have Style.

                            Tim Brown is the CEO of innovation and design firm IDEO, taking an approach to design that digs deeper than the surface. Having taken over from founder David E. Kelley, Tim Brown carries forward the firm’s mission of fusing design, business and social studies to come up with deeply researched, deeply understood designs and ideas — they call it “design thinking.” IDEO is the kind of firm that companies turn to when they want a top-down rethink of a business or product — from fast food conglomerates to high-tech startups, hospitals to universities. IDEO has designed and prototyped everything from a life-saving portable defibrillator to the defining details at the groundbreaking Prada shop in Manhattan to corporate processes. And check out the Global Chain Reaction for a sample of how seriously this firm takes play. Brown’s new book on design thinking will be published this fall.

                            Ron Arad (born 1951 in Tel Aviv, Israel) is an industrial designer, artist and architect. Ron Arad attended the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem between 1971-73 and the Architectural Association in London from 1974-79. He was Head of Design Products Department at the Royal College of Art from 1997 to 2009. In 2005, Arad designed chandeliers for the Swarovski crystal company which if one has the number, can display text messages that are sent to it by incorporating light-emitting diodes (LEDs) operated by SMS text messages. He also has had tables that climb walls instead of being centered in the room. [1] Arad’s works are often worked into distinctive biomorphic shapes and are created from his medium of choice, steel.[2] In 2008-09, Arad paired with KENZO to create his first perfume bottle. The bottle was on display in his exhibit No Discipline.

                            Philippe Starck is a legend of modern design. He’s known for his luxurious hotels and boites around the world — notably the Peninsula Hotel restaurant in Hong Kong, the Teatron in Mexico, the Hotel Delano in Miami, the Mondrian in Los Angeles, the Asia de Cuba restaurant in New York — designing the total environment from layout to furniture to linens. But he has made perhaps his most permanent mark on design through his bold reworkings of everyday objects. In reimagining and rethinking the quotidian, he has produced some of the iconic shapes of the 20th century, including his leggy chrome juice squeezer, the reimagined Emeco aluminum chairs, and the witty Louis Ghost polycarbonate fauteuil. When Starck turns his bold vision toward a chair, a shoe, a toothbrush, it’s clear he thinks deeper than the glossy surface.
